Hi, my name is Philippe Massicotte. As a *numerical ecologist*, the [R statistical computing language](https://www.r-project.org/) is an important part of my daily workflow. I mainly use R for environmental modelling and data manipulation. In this not-so-serious blog, I will present my recent R work as well as various data visualizations such as the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenges.

## Current research

I am currently working as a research associate at the [Takuvik Joint International Laboratory](http://www.takuvik.ulaval.ca/) under the supervision of [Dr. Marcel Babin](http://www.takuvik.ulaval.ca/team/marcel_babin.php).

**Some researches I am currently working on:**

- Understand how surrounding landscapes of aquatic ecosystems determine the biogeocycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM).

- Understand how DOM, as the main agent driving the optical properties of aquatic ecosystems, influences their functioning.

- Quantify how the complex mosaic composed of ice, snow, leads, melt ponds and open water influence underwater light regime in aquatic ecosystems.

- Influence of available irradiance under heterogeneous sea-ice conditions on phytoplankton primary production estimates.

**I am always looking for collaborations.** Do not hesitate to contact me!

## Scientific interests (no specific order)

- Dissolved organic matter (DOM) and carbon cycling

- Aquatic optic (fluorescence, absorbance, remote sensing)

- Mathematics

- Numerical analyses/modelling (multivariate analyses, spatial analyses, system dynamic)

- Scientific programming

- Image analysis

- Geomatic
