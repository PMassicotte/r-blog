      <description>It is easy to say that there is an increasing interest in publishing in open access journals. There are now more and more peer-reviewed open access journals where scientific research can be disseminated. That is why, as an academic, I recently decided to only review articles that are going to be published in open access journals. I will also strongly encourage the publication of my future articles in open access journals when I am the first author.</description>
