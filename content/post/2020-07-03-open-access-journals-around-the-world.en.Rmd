It is easy to say that there is an [increasing interest in publishing in open access journals](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/would-be-heavyweights-the-rise-of-open-access-mega-journals). There are now more and more peer-reviewed open access journals where scientific research can be disseminated. That is why, as an academic, I recently decided to only review articles that are going to be published in open access journals. I will also strongly encourage the publication of my future articles in open access journals when I am the first author.

## The Directory of Open Access Journal (DOAJ)

```{r download_data}
url <- pins::pin("https://doaj.org/csv")

df <- vroom::vroom(url) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

I recently discovered that the [Directory of Open Access Journal](https://doaj.org/) provides a curated list of high-quality open access journals. At this time, there are `r nrow(df)` journals indexed in their database. I found out that I could use this source of information to help me to find appropriate open access journals for my future research articles. DOAJ provides a list of their indexed journals as well as the countries in which they are published. I was interested to explore this data to know which countries publish open access journals. The following graph shows the first 20 countries listed in DOAJ in which open access journals are published. I was quite surprised to see that Indonesia was the country that publishes the most open access journals.

```{r open_journal_per_country}
df_viz <- df %>%
  count(country_of_publisher) %>%
  drop_na(country_of_publisher)

df_viz %>%
  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 20) %>%
  mutate(country_of_publisher = fct_reorder(country_of_publisher, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = country_of_publisher)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#2F4858") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = 1.5, color = "white") +
  labs(
    x = "Number of open journals",
    y = NULL,
    title = "Top 20 countries publishing open access journals",
    caption = "Data: https://doaj.org/ | Visualization @philmassicotte"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    plot.caption = element_text(
      family = "Montserrat",
      size = 6
    )
  )
```

> Indonesia may be the world's OA leader: the study found that 81% of ﻿20,000 journal articles published in 2017 with an Indonesia-affiliated author are available to read for free somewhere online, and 74% are published with open-access licences, meaning they could be legally redistributed (see ‘Open-access leaders’).

The number of open access journals in each country is presented in the following table.

```{r open_journal_per_country_table}
df_viz %>%
  reactable(
    columns = list(
      country_of_publisher = colDef(name = "Country", filterable = TRUE),
      n = colDef(name = "Number of open journals")
    )
  )
```

## A global overview

The next map shows a global overview of the number of published open access journals around the world.

#   anti_join(world, by = c("country_of_publisher" = "name_long"))
#
# world %>%
#   filter(str_detect(name_long, fixed("Viet", ignore_case = TRUE))) %>%
#   pull(name_long)

# Country name cleaning
df_viz <- df_viz %>%
  mutate(
    country_of_publisher = case_when(
      country_of_publisher == "Bolivia, Plurinational State of" ~ "Bolivia",
      country_of_publisher == "Congo, The Democratic Republic of the" ~ "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
